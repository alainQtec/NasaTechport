# NasaTechport

Without leaving your Terminal, discover the technologies NASA is working on every day.
NASA is working on technologies for propulsion, nanotechnology, robots, and human health.
To better serve its user communities, NASA is committed to making its data available and machine-readable via an Application Programming Interface (API).
As a result, the NASA TechPort system includes a RESTful web services API for making technology project data machine-readable.
This API allows you to export TechPort data into XML or JSON format, which can then be processed and analyzed.
The online API specification, https://api.nasa.gov/techport/api/specification?api key=DEMO KEY, contains
complete documentation of the available objects, properties, and RESTful URIs.
